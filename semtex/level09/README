The protocol of the icmp server: (S=server, C=client(you))

C->S icmp type 121 means "connection request" (syn)
S->C icmp type 122 means "connection accepted."
S<->C icmp type 123 means "data", this is the only packet that contains payload
S->C icmp type 124 means "already connected"
S->C icmp type 125 means "not connected/connection reset"

The rules:

If you send icmp type 121 (syn), you get back a icmp type 122 (accepted),
or, if you are still "connected", icmp type 124 (already connected).

If you dont send an icmp packet for one minute, your "connection" times out.

If you are not connected and send icmp type 123 (data),
you will receive icmp type 125 (not connected).

The payload in the data packets is always 1 byte, following bytes will
be ignored. These single bytes are your data stream.

You can receive a 125 any time, that means remote host closed connection.

You should ignore any packets that you receive from 127.0.0.1, since you
will receive your own packets that are sent through a raw socket!
